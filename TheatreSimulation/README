******************
* I. DESCRIPTION *
******************
	sim and lltest are a bundle which together provide the Movie Theatre Line
Simulation System in the Command Line/Terminal.
MTLSS requires two input files included when the program is executed. The program utilizes the 
patron information provided in the input file to generate simulation of how the patrons would
behave in real life. It outputs a file called report.txt into the a3 folder which contains 
information such as maximum, minimum and average time spent as well as the time spent in line 
per patron.

*******************
* II. COMPILATION *
*******************
	To compile:
1: Navigate to the a3 directory in Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Line (Windows)
2: Type 'make' then hit 'enter'
3. The screen should output two 'gcc' compile lines, if no errors are returned then compilation 
was successful. The executable files; 'lltest' & 'sim' and can be found in the /bin directory.

*********************************
* III. EXECUTION & INSTRUCTIONS *
*********************************
	To execute the program once it has compiled, navigate to the a3 directory and type;
'./bin/lltest'. This tests your Linked List Module
	
	The program will print a brief introduction, before testing your functions
	Updates should be printed out to the screen as your functions are tested
	The final results will be posted onto the screen before the program closes

	To execute the simulation navigate to the a3 directory and type
'./bin/sim docs/line1.txt docs/line2.txt
		-if your input files are not named line1.txt or line2.txt 
  then replace them with your filename
		-if your input files are not in the a3 directory than include the file path
    
	This program will print a brief introduction screen, please press enter.
	The simulation will output the initial lines of the theatre (ticket/snack).
	The simulation will then calculate the simulation statistics and output a small report
	to the terminal. It saves these reports to a file Report.txt in the a3 directory
					
*************************
* IV. KNOWN LIMITATIONS *
*************************
    Due to the time constraints and my lack of programming knowledge. This program was left with some know limitations;
	-The Snack Line sometimes bugs out when its been empty for a while then has more than one patron inside.
